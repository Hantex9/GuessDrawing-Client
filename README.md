#h1 GUESS DRAWING - CLIENT
Guess Drawing is a multiplayer app where players challenge each other to guess a word that will need to be represented by another player through a drawing. The round begins by taking a random person who will draw a random word chosen by the server and the other players will have to guess it, the first one guessing the word gets points. The winner of the game is the player who gets the most points at the end of the last round. The system is based on rooms where players can create on choosing the number of players and the number of rounds.
